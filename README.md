# Solver for the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model in continuous time
MATLAB routines for deriving the numerical solutions for the deterministic and stochastic versions of the celebrated Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model in continuous time.  I use the output of the deterministic version in classroom to give students a feel of how solving the model works, as well as to demystify the notion of the saddle path and make it more tangible -- even if not solved for analytically (and perhaps to peek their interest in numerical methods in macroeconomics).  The algorithm is based on the standard multidimensional version of the Newton-Raphson method in application to the respective Euler equation (deterministic or stochastic).

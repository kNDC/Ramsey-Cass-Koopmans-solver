# Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans-solver
MATLAB routines for deriving the numerical solutions for the deterministic and stochastic versions of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model in continuous time.  I use the output of the deterministic version in classroom to give a feel of how the model works and to demystify the notion of the saddle path and make it more tangible -- even if not solved for analytically.
